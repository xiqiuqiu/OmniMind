## 💡 Vision & Philosophy

**ThinkFlow AI** is dedicated to creating a high-efficiency workbench that transforms "ideas" into "structured graphs."

In traditional creation, inspiration is often fragmented and fuzzy. ThinkFlow AI redefines this process: simply input a core idea, and the application leverages the divergent power of AI to expand it into a hierarchical, interactive **Knowledge Graph**.

- **Modular Expansion**: Starting from core concepts, it automatically deduces and generates sub-modules, building a logically rigorous thinking network.
- **Infinite Depth Exploration**: Every node is just a beginning. You can continue to **follow-up and expand** any branch or dive deep into professional details through the "**Deep Answer**" feature.
- **Multidimensional Sensory Fusion**: Supports one-click **image generation** for nodes, weaving abstract logic with concrete visual imagery to achieve full-sensory knowledge internalization.

This is more than just a tool; it is a local-first thinking space that grows with you.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🚀 Intelligent Divergence System (AI-Driven Divergence)

- **Zero-Pressure Cold Start**: Enter a core concept, and the AI automatically builds the initial logical skeleton, ending "blank page anxiety."
- **Full-Chain Context Awareness**: The AI understands the complete logical path from the root node to the current node. This means every "follow-up" is based on deep context rather than isolated keywords.
- **Multi-style AI Generation**: Switch between "Creative" and "Precise" modes to control the breadth and depth of AI expansions.
- **Dynamic Tree Layout**: Built-in adaptive layout algorithm automatically handles collisions and overlaps when nodes expand, ensuring the graph remains clear and organized.

### 🔍 Deep Content Exploration (Deep Dive & Insights)

- **Professional-Grade Deep Analysis**: Generate 300-500 words of deep answers with one click, supporting Markdown rendering, covering concept explanations, case studies, and logical deductions.
- **Visual Imagery Generation**: Integrated CogView/DALL-E interfaces generate concrete images for abstract concepts, reinforcing sensory memory and multi-dimensional cognition.
- **Global Macro Insights**: Automatically scans the entire graph topology to extract key points and generate a global summary.

### 🛠️ Premium Interaction Experience

- **Immersive Presentation Mode**: One-click full-screen presentation with keyboard navigation (Arrow keys) to guide your audience through the map.
- **Global Search & Focus**: Real-time search for nodes by label or description with automatic viewport focusing.
- **Linked Dragging System**: Parent and child nodes move together, maintaining the relative stability of logical clusters.
- **Subtree State Management**: Supports subtree collapsing for large-scale graphs, allowing you to switch freely between macro vision and micro details.
- **Local-First Architecture**: All configurations and data are stored in the browser's IndexedDB/LocalStorage. Supports any OpenAI-compatible interface with no platform lock-in.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure your development environment has [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (v18+ recommended).

### 2. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ThinkFlowAI.git
cd ThinkFlowAI
npm install
```

### 3. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## ⚙️ Deployment & Private Configuration

### 1. Default Demo Endpoint Description

The project defaults to proxying requests via **Cloudflare Workers** to Zhipu Bigmodel (glm-4-flash/cogview-3-flash). Public interfaces have rate limits; developers are encouraged to configure private endpoints.

### 2. Custom API Configuration

Modify `DEFAULT_CONFIG` in [src/services/config.ts](file:///d:/lztcode/ThinkFlowAI/src/services/config.ts):

```typescript
export const DEFAULT_CONFIG = {
    chat: {
        baseUrl: 'https://api.your-provider.com/v1/chat/completions',
        model: 'gpt-4o',
        apiKey: 'sk-...' // Recommended to configure via environment variables or UI settings to avoid hardcoding
    },
    image: {
        baseUrl: 'https://api.your-provider.com/v1/images/generations',
        model: 'dall-e-3',
        apiKey: 'sk-...'
    }
}
```

### 3. Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```
