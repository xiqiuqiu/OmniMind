# Product Overview

**ThinkFlow AI** is a next-generation, local-first AI-powered mind mapping tool built with Vue 3 and VueFlow. It's designed as a "brain amplifier" that combines LLM capabilities with structured visualization to transform vague ideas into clear, deep knowledge systems.

## Core Value Proposition

- **AI-Driven Expansion**: Input a core concept and AI automatically expands outward based on logical pathways, breaking through "blank page anxiety"
- **Context-Aware Conversations**: Each node carries complete path context from root, enabling AI to understand reasoning chains and generate precise suggestions
- **Multi-Dimensional Content**: Text knowledge through deep answers, visual imagery through AI image generation, macro insights through session summaries
- **Privacy-First Architecture**: Local-first design with browser-based storage, supports any OpenAI-compatible API without platform lock-in
